I used the dawdle() function provided by the manual in the code. It's header
file is located in dawdle.h, and the main code is provided in dawdle.c.
No important compilation instructions.

QUESTIONS:
Are there supposed to be large gaps from EATING->CHANGING where the phil is 
holding onto both (or one) fork?
