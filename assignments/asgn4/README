No special instructions for running this program. All test cases from the
harness passed. 

Minix Changes (To install my driver):
- I followed (exactly) what the manual said to do when installing the driver 
	(what the To Do List said to do)
3) I added 'secretkeeper' to 'etc/system.conf' by basically copying the hello
	service block, and changing the name to 'secretkeeper'.
4) I created the device file '/dev/Secret' with the command 'mknod /dev/Secret 
	c 20 0' using the major and minor numbers as 20 and 0 respectively.
5a) I created the directory '/usr/src/drivers/secrets' and put in the following
	files: 'Makefile', 'secret.c', 'secret.h'
5b) Whenever I made changes to the driver I performed the 'make' and 'make
	install' to make sure it was up to date.
6) I SSGRANT to '/usr/src/include/sys/ioctl.h' to allow for ownership
	transfer by creating the respective header file, and adding the '#include' 
	statement provided in the manual. I then created another file at '/usr/src
	/include/sys/ioc_secret.h' and added the '#include' and '#define' statements 
	provided in the manual (the so called "magic lines").


Additional Notes:
- I performed a deep copy of the hello driver (as did everyone), so a large
	portion of the code was not written by me. I mainly modified the contents
	of secret_transfer, secret_open, secret_close, and the functions to handle
	saving the global states. The main and init functions were mostly untouched.
