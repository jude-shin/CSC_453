		\begin{enumerate}
			\item The virtual address of 20 is 20 bytes away from the start of the virtual page in the range 0K-4K. This means that it will be 20 bytes away from the associated page in the physical memory. The virtual page 0K-4K maps to the physical page 8K-12K. The virtual address 20 will be mapped to the physical address 8020.
			\item The virtual address of 4100 is 100 bytes away from the start of the virtual page in the range 4K-8K. This means that it will be 100 bytes away from the associated page in the physical memory. The virtual page 4K-8K maps to the physical page 4K-8K. The virtual address 4100 will be mapped to the physical address 4100.
			\item The virtual address of 8300  is 300 bytes away from the start of the virtual page in the range 8K-12K. This means that it will be 300 bytes away from the associated page in the physical memory. The virtual page 8K-12K maps to the physical page 24K-28K. The virtual address 8300 will be mapped to the physical address 24300.
