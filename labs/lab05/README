I included a built pdf in the handin for lab05, but I have a sneaking suspicion
that something might not work for the graph that I embedded as a figure. Anyways
, it is another case of "it works on my machine".

I inlcluded my Makefile, hitrate.eps, and labreport.tex files just in case
something didn't turn out right. I hope this doesn't mess anything up. I just
want to make sure my answers were recorded.

TL;DR
Try to look at my answers in the labreport.pdf file that I provided, and
if you can't see some things, then take a look at my labreport.tex.

Thank you!
